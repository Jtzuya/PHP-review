MySQL
~ Relational database management system that runs on a server
: Data can be related to one another, with the usage of 'foreign keys'
: Foreign keys are used to link tables together in the database
~ To communicate with the database from PHP(backend of this review) or other language, we use a query language called SQL
SQA = Structured Query Language

Communication between the database and the backend to dos:
~ create (POST) a new data to the database
~ retrieve (GET) the data from the database
~ delete (DELETE) the data from the database
~ update (UPDATE) the data from the database
and more...

Each record in the database is stored in a table
~ ROWS, each row represents an individual record in the table
~ COLUMN, each column represents a property on that record

MAIN TAKEAWAYS
~ A database can contain several tables
~ Each table stores a particular model of data
~ Each row represents a single record
~ Each column represents a property on of that record
~ We use SQL to communicate with the database from PHP (backend)

###### WHY THIS FILE HAS .env or .inc IN IT?
```html
    It is just a naming convention and has nothing to do with the code
```

###### Where did you get this .env thing?
```html
    As Javascript is my first programming language. I've seen that people are storing SECRET KEYS inside the '.env' file.
    And that is why I come up with this naming convention
```

###### How about .inc?
```html
    Well, first off. This file should be set as db.inc.php and why they are using '.inc' is just a naming convention means to include since this type of file 
    is living under the 'includes' directory
```
